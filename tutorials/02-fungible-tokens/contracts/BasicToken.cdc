// BasicToken.cdc
//
// The BasicToken contract is a sample implementation of a fungible token on Flow.
//
// Fungible tokens behave like everyday currencies -- they can be minted, transferred or
// traded for digital goods.
//
// Follow the fungible tokens tutorial to learn more: https://docs.onflow.org/docs/fungible-tokens
//
// This is a basic implementation of a Fungible Token and is NOT meant to be used in production
// See the Flow Fungible Token standard for real examples: https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft

    // The functions in the Vault and governed by the pre and post conditions
    // in the interfaces when they are called.
    // The checks happen at runtime whenever a function is called.
    //
    // Resources can only be created in the context of the contract that they
    // are defined in, so there is no way for a malicious user to create Vaults
    // out of thin air. A special Minter resource or constructor function needs to be defined to mint
    // new tokens.

    // and store the returned Vault in their storage in order to allow their
    // account to be able to receive deposits of this token type.
